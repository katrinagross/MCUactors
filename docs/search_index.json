[["index.html", "MCU Actor Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " MCU Actor Analysis Katrina Gross &amp; Andy Ward 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction We were interested in budget and box office trends for movies. Specifically, we wanted to explore the division between actors performing in large budget movies and smaller, low-budget projects. There has been recent discussion about whether directors who join high-production value projects with projected high box offices do so in order to work on smaller “passion projects”. We chose to look at the highest grossing film franchise - the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). We wanted to see if this hypothesis proved to be true for actors in the MCU. We set out to answer a few questions: 1) When do MCU actors join the MCU in their career? 2) How do high box-office movies enable actors to work on low-budget projects? 3) Do the actors with the most success in their MCU films also have the most success in their non-MCU endeavors? 4) Is there a correlation between box-office success, film budget, and the fame of the starring actors for these movies? We are also interested in this topic as we are both MCU fans. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We used the Online Movie Database through rapid api. This contains IMDb data with actor and film information scraped from IMDb. IMDb does have an API, but it is unstructured so we opted to use the API through rapid API. We used multiple endpoints through the API (described in detail in part 3). We did numerous spot checks throughout to ensure we were getting the desired results. We also used the Wikipedia page to scrape for the movie titles. We would have used the API, but we didn’t have time to change it in the end. Additionally, we downloaded ratings from IMDb’s data interface. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Our data transformation efforts took the most time since we had to aggregate a dataset based on varying queries to the API. Below are the steps we took to create the final dataset. Every query yielded slightly different content, so it took quite a bit of testing to find what data fields worked for our purposes. STEP 1 Movie_Titles.RMD: First we scraped the movie titles from Wikipedia. We did this using the rvest package in R and scraped two tables: one for the Infinity Saga one for Phase Four. We then cleaned the two tables, filtering for only movies that had been released, and combined them into one master set. The output of this effort was a dataframe with all of the movie titles as well as some additional details (main actors, year, director(s), etc.). We then used this in the next step to query the API. STEP 2 Movie_Ids_IMDB.RMD: Once we had a list of the movie titles, we then had to query the API to match via string match for the ids of the movies inherent to the API. We used the “auto-complete” endpoint in the title section of the API. After putting all of our movie titles in a dictionary to query on - we ran the queries through a for loop for every item in the dictionary. We verified the results since the query returned partial string matches - we removed all of the movie titles that did not match our list. STEP 3 Movie_Ids_IMDB.RMD: With the movie ids, we could get information relevant to those movies. We pulled the entire cast list as well as the top cast. Both were problematic, the entire cast list had about 90 names per film, including stunt doubles and extras that appeared across multiple MCU films. The “top-cast” endpoint only pulled two actors per film, which did not provide enough coverage. (This step also ended up being irrelevant based on how we pulled the data later, this was removed in the most recent push) STEP 4 MCU_Actors.RMD: At this point we wanted to create a list of top actors for each MCU movie we wanted to analyze. This proved to be somewhat difficult since, as mentioned above, the API did not provide an easy option for the scope we wanted. We did not want to include every actor in the MCU as that would have been too many, we also did not want to only include the top two. Ideally, we could have used a metric such as screen time, but that was not feasible or accurate due to the inclusion of the TV shows. We ended up using the top two actors from the original pull of movie ids, and augmented them with a manual list of actors we felt were important to include. STEP 5 MCU_Actors.RMD: Once we had our list of actor names, we had to get ids for the actors. We did something similar as in step 2 - built out a dictionary and passed the queries through a for loop. We pulled multiple sets of data based on the actor id: Filmography: which movies/tv shows every actor is credited in. For this we used the “get-all-filmography” endpoint. We cleaned these results and created a combined filmography dataframe for all of the actors. This dataframe has a similar issue as before, where if the actor is credited in the movie or TV show, it will show up as a result. We decided to include all of the results. Award Data: then for every MCU actor, we queried the “get-awards” endpoint for nominations and awards won by the actors. We decided to only include Oscars and Emmys because we did not think awards like Teen’s Choice Awards were relevant for this analysis. Business for Films: for all of the films in the combined actor filmography, we queried box office and budget information for each movie id. We then had to convert numbers to U.S. dollars if they were listed in another currency which we did in currency_conversion.Rmd. STEP 6 Combine_Data.RMD: Our last step before combining the data was getting the release date for each movie or TV show every actor was credited for. We did this because we wanted to do time series analysis. We used the “get-overview-details” endpoint for this query. Similar to before, we built a dictionary and queried over each dictionary key using a for loop and added the results to a dataframe. STEP 7 Combine_Data.RMD: We downloaded ratings data from IMDb and joined it onto our data frame by title id. STEP 8 Combine_Data.RMD: To combine all of the data, we joined the actor filmography data with the awards data, business data, and the release date data. We did so by joining on movie id. We then looked for inconsistencies across the dataset, for example names of actors that were the same as MCU actors, but were from the 1920’s (this was true for another Tom Holland). We removed these instances and finalized our dataset. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values As seen in the chart, there is some consistency to the NA values. The first thing to note is that there are no NA values from any of actor_name through type. This means that for every row in the data set, we will always be able to call upon the actor’s name, the movie or TV series title, the year it was released, and whether it was a movie or a TV series. Also, there are no missing values in any of the columns after the awards, outside of a small few in the Average Rating column and the Number of Votes column. The next key relationship for NA values is in the five award related columns. 96.43% of the rows in each of those five columns have all NA values. However, it can be seen that if a row has an NA value in one of the five, it necessarily has an NA value in the other four as well. This is due to how we transformed the data. We only included a value for the movies and TV shows that were nominated for the selected awards we chose to include. If they were not nominated, then all five columns will have an NA. If they were, then all five columns will have data explaining the award name, award category, event name, whether the nominee won, and the year of the award. It is nice that there are no instances where awards are listed for some award columns but not others, so that any analysis involving awards can be complete. Finally, we have to look into the columns including budget and box office data. There are various amounts of missing data from these columns, ranging from 31% missing to 43% missing. It looks like there may be some correlation by row for some of these missing values, so we take a slightly closer look at the data to see if we can find it. Filtering the data for only including rows that contain a movie vs only including rows that contain a TV Series makes the connection very clear. It can be seen that every single TV Series (bottom) is missing a budget value, and just about every TV Series is missing Box Office numbers. So now, when looking at Box Office success and budget values, we know that TV Series won’t have any information in that area. We can also see that there are now far fewer, albeit still some, NA values in the budget and box office columns for the movie data (top). To avoid having these NAs cause complications in our analyses of these values, we decided to not include those rows in any calculations that involved numerical operations, such as finding the mean of box office success for a particular actor’s filmography. In this plot illustrating the aggregated missing patterns, we can see that the most common missing pattern is just to have all four award columns be missing. This pattern represents the most common type of row in our data set, which is movies that did not get nominated for any award. This pattern accounts for over 50% of the data. The next most common pattern is again missing those four award columns, but also missing the box office and budget values. Accounting for about a quarter of the data, these rows most typically refer to TV shows and some smaller movies. The only other really significant pattern is that which is missing the four award columns, but also just missing the budget data. This pattern is seen in just under 10% of the data, and highlights rows where there is box office data, but no information on the budget. Beyond that, any other patterns are very infrequent. Complete cases, rows that have no missing values at all, only make up about 2% of the total number of rows, but this is to be expected when so many of the rows have NAs in the awards columns. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Movie Analysis 5.2 Actor Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Movie Analysis In this section we analyze the MCU as a whole - as it relates to budget, box office, ratings, and gender of main actors. 5.1.1 Budget and Box Office Here we can see the breakdown of international and domestic box office numbers across MCU films. Endgame is far above the others, at almost $3 billion world wide gross, , followed by Infinity War and Spiderman: No Way Home. Ten of the movies gross above $1 billion. The orange dashed line represents international gross of the non-MCU movies these actors are in. All of the MCU films have higher international gross rates than that of the average non-MCU film, many tend to dwarf this figure. We can see just how much blockbusters, particularly the MCU, has changed the film industry and the definition of a successful film franchise. This is often a point of contention among film critics - how far should fandom go and is the Marvel machine never-ending? Are movies like those of the MCU pushing out smaller filmmakers, or is there room for both in cinema? Here we look at the relationship between the film’s budget and its Box Office success across all of the MCU movies. When making a movie, the hope would typically be that if you invest more resources into making the film, you will reap the benefits of greater returns. For the most part, when it comes to the MCU films, that is generally true. However, it is definitely the case that there are other factors at play when it comes to Box Office success. It is particularly interesting to look at the Phase 4 MCU films here. It appears as though each Phase 4 film had the same budget to work with, yet one movie received a disproportionately high Box Office return, while the other three had some of the lowest Box Office to Budget ratios. Clearly, budget was not the main differentiating factor here. One major determinant here was the Covid-19 pandemic. Stay-at-home and isolation orders caused a major blow to the cinema industry, as far fewer people were going out to see any movies. Thus, movies released during that time were destined to fare worse in the Box Office. Also during this time, possibly as a response, Disney made the decision to begin releasing their MCU movies on their streaming service, Disney+, just about 45 days after the theatrical release of the movie. This further incentivized potential movie-goers to stay home, because it wouldn’t be long before they’d be able to see the movie at home anyway, so they wouldn’t feel as though they were missing much by skipping the theater trip. The final Phase 4 film, Spider-Man: No Way Home, conversely, had nearly the opposite situation. This movie’s release came after the initial pandemic protocols had larger passed. Further, since the Spider-Man property is still in a bit of a tangle between Disney and Sony, No Way Home would not be coming to Disney+ any time in the near future. This, in turn, convinced many people who had been content to skip over the theater experience to feel as though this was a film they couldn’t miss. Adding to that, the Spider-Man character was already one that generated more excitement than a few of the protagonists from the MCU’s immediately preceding movies. All those factors combined to result in a Box Office explosion of nearly two billion dollars. Also, it is worth noting that the majority of the MCU films with the highest budget are the big team up films, including the four Avengers movies, as well as Captain America: Civil War, which featured much of the Avengers team. So, Disney might know ahead of time that those particular movies will draw in a larger audience, and thus know that they need to increase the budget of those films to guarantee they are putting out a higher quality product. Thus, while there might be a slight correlation between budget and Box Office success, there are also other factors at play that suggest that simply throwing a massive budget towards a film doesn’t guarantee success at the Box Office. Here we look at the Box Office success of the combined filmography of all the actors in our study. Before Iron Man kicked off the MCU in 2008, we can see that a few of these actors appeared in a handful of blockbuster movies, including entries from the Jurassic World and Star Wars universes. However, once the MCU established themselves in the movie landscape, we see that many of the blockbusters that our actors appeared in did in fact from the MCU. A few movies stand out far above the crowd, including Avengers: Endgame, which challenged Avatar for the highest Box Office total of any movie. One of the many impressive feats of the MCU is their general lack of complete misfires. Even the lowest Box Office returns among the MCU movies still rank highly when compared to the majority of films that these actors appear in. Suffice it to say, when an actor signs on for a role in an MCU movie, they can be quite certain that the film will receive a much higher Box Office return than the average non-MCU film. 5.1.2 Movie Ratings Here we can see the distribution of ratings and box office for MCU and non-MCU movies (all from actors in the MCU). We can see that ratings for MCU movies are all above 6. For non-MCU movies, although most of the ratings are above 6, there are quite a few under that. We can also see a cluster of darker blue in the non-MCU chart with low box-office numbers. Although again, the scale is somewhat distorted due to the very high grossing films in the MCU and Avatar, not in the MCU. 5.1.3 Gender of Main Actors &amp; Awards From this gender breakdown, we can first see that there are more men in the MCU than women. We can also see that the average number of films actresses have done before entering the MCU exceeds that of men, but not by much. For both men and women, all Oscars were won before doing an MCU film. Women in the MCU have slightly more award nominations (“Nom”) than men after being in the MCU. The MCU mainly highers well-known actors, so this breakdown may not be surprising. Although it could suggest that actors are less likely to win an Oscar after participating in an MCU film. More likely it is that MCU films take up large amounts of time for actors, and while the payout exceeds that of other types of films, actors are not likely to be nominated or win Oscars for blockbuster movies like these, despite excellent performances. We do see some Emmy nominations for the more recent MCU TV shows - Wandavision and Falcon and the Winter Soldier were both nominated for a few awards, but did not win any. 5.2 Actor Analysis In this section we analyze the actors in the MCU - as it relates to their success across films within and outside of the MCU. 5.2.1 Actor Filmography For most of the actors, the MCU films are the highest grossing films that they are a part of. For some actors, there are a few other notably high grossing films, such as Star Wars, Jurassic World, Avatar, and the Hobbit movies. MCU box office numbers tend to dwarf those of other films, so the comparison is somewhat difficult. There is not a clear pattern indicating that actors who work on MCU movies, then follow with smaller scale productions. Although it does seem that after Endgame (the last very large blue dot form 2019), many of the actors have participated in far fewer films than they did before. This could also be due to Covid slowing the release dates of many productions. Most actors have quite a few roles before entering the MCU (only showing after 1990). The MCU tends to bring on more known actors - every actor that has won an Oscar has done so before being in an MCU film. There are a few actors Zendaya, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, who had sparse movie credits before entering the MCU. Zendaya is more famous for her role as Rue in Euphoria, for which she was the youngest actress to recieve the Emmy for best actress. Here we look at the count of movies for each actor across the decades. Michael Douglas is the only actor with roles dating back to the 60’s. Samuel L. Jackson appeared in many movies over the course of his career. Most actors appear in the most number of movies in the 2000’s and 2010’s, which makes sense since Marvel movies started in 2008. Most actors did not start acting in movies until the 2000’s. For most actors in the MCU, their first credited role is on a TV show. This makes sense for actors starting young or having a small role on a show. Movies are somewhat clustered for release dates, there is a cluster of first appearances in movies around the late 80’s - 90’s and the three most recent debuts were in movies. 5.2.2 Box Office Success &amp; Ratings Here we look at the Average Box Office success of each actor before and after their first MCU film. This graph does not include the values from any MCU movies themselves. For example, even though Iron Man 2 came out after Iron Man, and would thus count towards Robert Downey Jr’s average Box Office success after his first MCU film, we did not include it in calculating the average. That choice was made because the Box Office numbers for pretty much all MCU movies are through the roof and would skew the data to heavily favor the “after” average. The idea was to see if the movies these actors were in were generally more successful after these actors made their appearance in the MCU, so for that reason we wanted to separate them from the MCU films themselves that are destined to do well in the Box Office. With that distinction made, we turn to the data. It turns out, there does not seem to be much of a trend in either direction. There are a few extreme cases in both directions, but ultimately it does not appear that there is any guarantee that appearing in an MCU film will make people all flock to the next non-MCU film starring that actor. Possibly the biggest increase that we see is from Chris Pratt, who first appeared as Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy, back in 2014. The average Box Office return for movies featuring Chris Pratt approximately quadrupled after he made his first MCU appearance. However, we once again want to look a bit deeper into the underlying reasons as to why that is. In looking at Pratt’s filmography, we see that he starred in a few of the Jurassic World movies after his MCU debut. The Jurassic World universe was already an established film series, and was set to be a blockbuster that brought in impressive Box Office numbers. Was that success increased as a result of Chris Pratt’s fame from starring in an MCU movie, or were the numbers for those movies always going to be high? In truth, there is probably a little bit of both. On the reverse end of the spectrum, Evangeline Lilly saw the biggest decrease in average Box Office success. Her case is nearly the opposite of Chris Pratt’s. Having appeared in the Hobbit movies before her first MCU film, her average beforehand was actually the highest of any actor in this study. Additionally, she has only appeared in a couple smaller films after her MCU debut in Ant-Man. As such, she was our biggest faller. Overall, though, there is almost no trend to predict whether an actor will increase or decrease in their average Box Office returns after debuting in an MCU film. Here we play around with quite a few relationships for each actor. First, it’s worth noting that the lines are colored by when the actor made their first MCU appearance, a different color indicating each of the four “Phases” in the MCU. Of course, it isn’t much surprise that the actors who first joined in Phase 1 generally have the most MCU film appearances, as they’ve had the most opportunities to be in them. This trend sort of continues into total film appearances (not including MCU films). Of the actors who got their start in Phase 3 or 4, they are mostly near the bottom of the total films list. This indicates that for the new actors that the MCU has been bringing in recently, they have been generally hiring lesser known actors compared to those who have already had an extensive film career. Speaking of extensive film careers, it was fun to note just how many films Samuel L Jackson has appeared in. He is so far ahead in the total film count that he looks to be an outlier in the data. There actually appears to be a little bit of clustering among the actors who joined in Phase 1. This could be the result of sharing many of their MCU movies together. A lot of those actors ended up appearing in all of the Avengers movies, and so the MCU related stats ended up being very similar, the only differences coming from any difference in the actors’ respective standalone films, but even those don’t have quite as much effect on the data here because of all the various Avengers films adding weight to the average. There does not appear to be too much correlation between the average Box Office success for actors from their MCU movies to their non-MCU movies. Thus it doesn’t appear as though featuring in the highest performing MCU movies will mean that the non-MCU movies will also be as successful, and vice versa. Similarly, there does not seem to be any major trend between the average ratings for each actor’s MCU films to their non-MCU films.

The majority of actors who appear in the MCU usually have a fairly rich filmography beforehand, many of which began in a TV Series, then build up with a few, or in some cases many, strong performances in larger films. Thus, with the exception of a few outliers, there does not really seem to be a drastic change of career arc following an MCU appearance. Further, there does not end up being a strong relationship between the performance of MCU movies featuring particular actors with the performance of the movies that those actors starred in outside of the MCU. That is to say, the consistent box-office success that the MCU enjoys seems to be relatively independent of the actors they choose to cast. It seems as though these MCU films unerringly result in huge box-office return, even in their “less successful” entries. Even when it may seem as though the MCU has finally hit a rut and fallen back down to Earth with a few movies in Phase 4 that returned lower-than-expected box-office numbers on their lofty standards, a much wider phenomenon was afoot, namely the Covid-19 pandemic that lowered box-office numbers across all movies. Beyond that, Disney seems to recognize when they are getting to a point in their saga that will attract a much wider audience, so there is a pretty solid correlation between larger budgets and higher box-office returns. The MCU is truly a rare occurrence in filmmalking. The ability to create an interconnected story across so many movies, while keeping each individual film entertaining enough such that there is practically never a misfire in terms of box-office success or rating, is quite impressive. You might even say that the universe that has been created is something to “marvel” at.
